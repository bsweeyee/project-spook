# project-spook

A simple gamemaker project brought to you by Brandon and Walrus.

Label priority:
high: Must include in game or cannot be considered finished
      May be included:
      - Things that make the game look/feels good (eg. should the movement have slight acceleration or pure linear speed?)
      
      Should not be included:
      -Optimizations (Unless game runs ridiculously poorly on COMMON platforms (eg. Framerates consistently <60 on Windows 7))
      
medium: Will include in game if we decide it will add additional value + takes <1 day to implement + does not detract from high priority         tasks for the day/week
      May be included:
      - Polish and details (eg. player idle animation)
      
low: Will likely not end up in the first iteration of complete product
      May be included:
      - Multiple projectiles (Since this game does not focus too much on projectile types. Projectiles are "implemented" as enemies)
